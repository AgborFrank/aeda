# Translation Rules for Intellygen

## Word Count Matching Rule


When translating any text on the Intellygen site, especially titles, headlines, and hero text, ensure the translated version has the **same word count** as the English original.
-- ALWAYS Create a new translation file for each page and add the file to translations.ts

### Guidelines:

1. **Count words first** - Always count words in both English and translated versions
2. **Maintain same message** - Keep the core meaning and impact intact
3. **Use concise alternatives** - Choose shorter/more direct words when needed
4. **Preserve technical terms** - Keep technical terminology appropriately translated
5. **Maintain professional tone** - Ensure the translation sounds natural and professional
6. **Match exact word count** - The final translation must have the same number of words
7. **Create separate translation file for each page** - Every page should have its independent translation file
### Example:

**English:** "Build better Startups, Scalable, and AI solutions — faster" (8 words)

**French:** "Créez de meilleures Startups, Scalables et IA — plus vite" (8 words)

### Why This Matters:

- ✅ **Consistent visual layout** across languages
- ✅ **Maintains design integrity** 
- ✅ **Ensures equal impact** in both languages
- ✅ **Professional presentation** 
- ✅ **Better user experience**

### Implementation:

- Always check word count before finalizing translations
- If word count doesn't match, revise with alternative phrasing
- Prioritize message clarity over literal translation
- Test both versions for visual consistency

*This rule ensures that all translations maintain the same visual and textual impact across English and French versions of the Intellygen website.*
