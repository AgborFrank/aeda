APSIM – AFRICAN PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT MEETINGS

Africa’s private sector is a key driver of economic growth, job creation, and innovation across
the continent. However, challenges such as limited access to investment, fragmented markets,
and insufficient cross-border collaboration hinder the sector’s full potential. The African
Economic Development Agency (AEDA) seeks to address these challenges by providing a
platform for dialogue, partnership, and investment mobilization through the Quarterly African
Private Sector Investment Meetings (APSIM).
Objective:
APSIM aims to strengthen Africa’s private sector by facilitating meaningful engagement
between investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and development partners. The meetings will
promote investment opportunities, share best practices, and foster collaboration across industries
and regions.
Key Features:
 Participants: Private sector leaders, investors, government representatives, development
agencies, and industry experts.
 Format: Panel discussions, keynote presentations, pitch sessions for innovative
enterprises, networking sessions, and sector-specific roundtables.
 Focus Areas:
o Investment opportunities across key sectors (agriculture, energy, technology,
infrastructure, and manufacturing)
o Public-private partnerships (PPPs)
o Regional trade and market integration
o Sustainable and inclusive business practices

Expected Outcomes:
 Increased awareness of investment opportunities within Africa
 Strengthened cross-border partnerships and collaborations
 Mobilization of capital for African enterprises
 Enhanced policy dialogue between private sector and governments
Conclusion:
The Quarterly African Private Sector Investment Meetings provide a strategic platform for
unlocking Africa’s economic potential, promoting sustainable growth, and accelerating private
sector development. APSIM is envisioned as a flagship initiative that bridges investors and
African enterprises, fostering a resilient and prosperous economic future for the continent.
